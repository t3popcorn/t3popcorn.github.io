Chopstick Boilerplate
=====================

Chopstick Boilerplate is a mobile-first responsive Design Boilerplate built with Sass, Jekyll and Gulp.

## Requirements

1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and [rubygems](https://rubygems.org)
2. [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.org)

## Install

You only need to do this once in a new project.
First, `cd` into the project root (where this file is).
Install [bundler](http://bundler.io) and the necessary Ruby dependencies:

    gem update --system && gem install bundler
    bundle install

Install [bower](http://bower.io) and the necessary JavaScript dependencies:
	
	npm install -g bower
	bower install

Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and the necessary gulp dependencies:

	npm install -g gulp
	npm install

## Use

We use Gulp as our task runner. There are some basic tasks defined but these can be easily extended by changing the `gulpfile.js`.

To compile Chopstick Boilerplate, `cd` into the project root and run:

	gulp

This will compile the `scss` and build the Jekyll site.

For development there is also a watch task wich will load a browsersync server and watch your all your files (*.html, *.md, *.scss, *.js, *.jpg, *.png, *.svg) for changes:

	gulp watch

Browsersync also works as a server for your devices. More info can be found on the [browsersync site](http://www.browsersync.io/).

We try to keep the code as modular as possible. So you can comment out what you don’t use. Simply put:

    Settings + Mixins + Patterns = Chopstick Boilerplate

The boilerplate can be used as a **styleguide**, to build **static websites** or to speed up making **HTML prototypes**.

It uses a settings file + mixins + patterns. You can remove the default theme folder and just use some components from the patterns, as you see fit. We don’t like too much default generated code and neither should you.

For more information and examples please refer to the [documentation on our website](http://getchopstick.com/docs).

## Credits

We owe a ton of credits to the following projects for inspiration:

* Boilerplate
* Foundation and Bootstrap
* Semantic Grid System
